      <h3>Background & Origin</h3>

        Hello, I am Rosean Frank-Alexander, another self-taught Product & UI / UX Designer. Born in Brooklyn, NY my family is originally from the island of Trinidad and Tobago. However, through a series of fortunate circumstances I had the pleasure of living in Durham, NC for my formative years and for many more afterwards. My affinity for computers and tech started with my grandmother purchasing a Compaq Presario which included a great music video for Buddy Holly by Weezer. Little did I know then, that moment sparked my interest in software, music but it took some time before it became the foundation of my future interests.

      <h3>Interests</h3>

      <p class="lead mt-4 mb-5 background-content">

        Naturally, as I had to facilitate a considerable amount of self-learning principles, I was able to act upon my interets and personal creativity. First, I loved sports as a child and my love of football (Soccer) converted into a commited desire to play basketball (many thanks to Duke, UNC and college basketball) which I did throughout high school. In those years, I participated in choir and stared to learn to play music instruments. As a student you could always find doodles next to my notes, and if you did not find me practicing for sports or choir I would be in the computer lab. This led to me accepting technology award my senior year that was honestly a huge surprise.

Vermiculture is the process of rearing worms to create vermicompost. The combination of food waste (vegetable-based) bedding materials, and vermicast creates an organic nutrient-rich fertilizer.</p>

            <p class="lead fw-normal text-justify text-muted mb-0">The COO had recently joined to replace one of the original co-founders and saw the financial benefit of creating an online store to increase sales. At the time, a majority of their sales were via the farmers market, word of mouth, the website’s blog, and e-mail. New Soil did have a website but it had not been updated since it was first created. Neither of the owners had any website experience but the COO did have a technical background to learn processes.They wanted to be able to update and make changes after the project was completed.</p>
